# api

The Bismuth API is a relatively simple CRUD API for managing organizations, projects (repos), features (branches), chat sessions, etc.
Basically anything the CLI can do outside the interactive chat communicates with this API.

There's very little that needs to be configured - consult the root [docker-compose.yaml](/docker-compose.yaml) for most options.
